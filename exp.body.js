Depending on your own answer, your devotion to bodybuilding will define your success in it as well.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">2- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Motivation</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Don’t listen to just anyone who tells you this and that. Learn from the pro ( I’d recommend Arnold Schwarzenegger ) and find your motivation with those who has done it forever. Not someone who just started few months ago.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">3- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">The gym</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> : Find a good gym. Not just the cheapest. Good gym should be “clean” for locker rooms. Machines that works well, enough space to not have to wait 15 minute to try one machine or weights. Some gyms are open 7 days a week and close their doors at 8pm.. some others close at 11pm… some never close. Figure out what hours works best for you.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">4- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Hot Girls</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Beware of “hot girls” in the gym. When you work out, you “work out”. Spending your time </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">“chit-chatting”</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> with the hottest girl at the gym means your “not” training .. therefore.. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; background: none;\">you are not really serious</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> about bodybuilding. A little “hi” and a smile is sufficient. ( Girls like it when you look busy anyways ) If you want to have a conversation, it has to be “outside” your training hours. Be serious… or get out.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">5- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Spotters</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Most people will be glad to “spot” you. However, some people have no experience in spotting and will destroy your reps. Doing so, wil also diminish you’re gal to success. Ask a spot from someone who “knows” how to spot. Spotting can have a large impact on either you will grow.. either you will stay “tiny”.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">7- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Music</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Some gyms will put “strange” music. I’d recommend to use your own music and make a favorist list of all your best work out music. Listening to “Dancing Queen” while dead lifting 300 pounds… doesn’t help.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">8- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Diet</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Eat properly. No matter how hard you train, without proper food, your muscle won’t grow. If your intentions are to slim, then eat the right food for dieting.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">9- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Sleep</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Even if you train hard and eat well, if you don’t sleep 8 hours a day, you don’t let your muscles have enough time to recover. Sleep is as important as working out and eating properly.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">10- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Supplements</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Supplements is “good” ONLY if you need it for a specific reason. ( Competition, special events, photoshooting, etc ). Apart from that, your just wasting your money. Supplements can be good if used moderatly. But I’d recommend to “never” use them. Why? Because supplements are like any other addictions. When you start, it’s hard to stop… and if you stop… you’ll feel that you’ll need to buy some more…and it can be very costy at the end.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">11- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Steroids</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Steroids is subject where some bodybuilders will have divided opinions on it. I’ll tell you what I think. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">DON’T TAKE ANY</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">. Period. Steroids is like “cheating” at school for your exams… yes, you will have good grades.. but do you deserves those grades? Ah. So if your the “cheater” type.. go ahead and take steroids… but there are consequences. Consequences can be harsher then you think… even “fatal”.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">12- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Trainer</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: I have many different trainers during my 25 years of bodybuilding experience. The best trainers are the one that will teach you the “basics” properly. Some trainers will teach you “advance” methods… which is good. But if you start, find a trainer that is “pro” at basics methods. Some trainers are only good with “advance” bodybuilder.. so you will hurt yourself if you jump straght ahead with them.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">13- </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Persistance</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Many people around the world makes “false” claim of “of promising themselves to start working out… get better health…get richer.. etc etc bla bla b la. But never keeps their words. If you’re not persistent, everything above, is obsolete.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Just like Arnold said, it’s not about how “fast” you grow in the gym, it’s about how “long and persistent” you are.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Cheers</span></p> ",

The mistakes you make are your lessons. I would like to share some of the mistakes I made during my intial days/years. I started going to the gym during my first year in college. It was a crappy gym with very few equipment. They had a few dumbbells and and a couple of barbells. The worst part was</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">there was no trainer</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">. Yes, you heard it right. A gym filled with many first timers and beginners like myself and no trainer. This was enough to give you a list of mistakes I made as a beginner. Let me try to recollect and list down a few:</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Not doing sufficient warm up.</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"><br>* Doing </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">bicep curls on my first day</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> and regretting it for the rest of the week.<br>* Thinking </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">isolation movements</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> are better than compounded movements.<br>* Trying to curl 20kg before I could properly bench press the same weight.<br>* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Never training my legs</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> in those days.<br>* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">No cardio</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> ever.<br>* No clue about the significance of protein in my diet and eating all the rice and everything I could eat in the hostel mess, thinking it is good for me as am working out now.<br>* The worst mistake I ever made though was </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">improper form</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">, resulting from doing certain workouts without any guidance or supervision. I just see someone do something and then try to imitate it. Within a year I managed to injure my wrists, shoulders and knees.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">It has been </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">7 years since my first day at the gym</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> and now when I look back, everyone of those mistakes and injuries have taught me important lessons. Be smart. It is okay to make mistakes. But it is never okay to be stubborn and to not adapt or to not learn from your mistakes.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Last, but definitely not the least, your nutrition. You are what you eat! Get enough protein. Get enough carbs, fats and other nutrients to support your body. The question is what is enough. If you are really serious about working out and is training hard then you need to consume about 1-2 gms of protein per pound of your body weight. Again, this is applicable only if you are training hard and lifting heavy. If you are looking to bulk up, then you need to eat a calorie surplus; meaning more carbs and fats. If you are trying to cut down, then eat at a calorie deficit. Try to make sure that your diet contains as much raw food as you can think of. Besides that, cook as much as you can and avoid processed/canned foods as much as possible. Have a cheat meal every week to keep yourself in the game and to not feel like you are punishing yourself.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Also, make sure to bring about sufficient variety in your routine once every 2 months or so. These are some generic rules for starters. If you can follow them you should be on the right track. By that time you would have had enough experience or made enough friends in body building who knows the craft better than someone who is not into it but has only a general idea of the proceedings.</span></p> ",

Nutrition is a bigger component of bodybuilding than just working out. Ensure that you get adequate protein, fats, and that your glycogen stores are  replete with carbs. Drink plenty of water. Eat lean protein, lots of fruits and vegetables, and limit \"cheat\" days.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">2. As Bart mentions above, ensure that your form is good. This is extremely important. There are famous bodybuilders out there who curl 30 lbs with perfect form -- the reason is not because that they can't curl more, but because they are focusing on perfect form and muscle control and not just the weight. The weight is secondary.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">3. Weight lifting is about control. You have to will yourself to use the right muscles. Lifting weights without any thought to it would mean that you engage the wrong muscle group in a lift. You ever see curl bros in the gym who bend back and do weird things to lift weights that are clearly too heavy for them? Yeah, they're doing it wrong. Make sure you are engaging the right muscles for any lift. Otherwise, you risk serious injury.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">4. Bodybuilding is a science. Make sure you are tracking your nutrition, your workouts, your weights - everything. </span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">5. Use a tried and tested program. Ultimately, the big three (i.e., bench, squats, dead lifts) and a few others to augment will do more than any detailed program. And the corollary is that any workout program without the big 3 is incomplete at best.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">6.

Nutrition: Eat plenty of whole foods. Protein isnt as important as its made out to be. Carbs are more important. Keep protein at 0.5*body weight (in Kg). Eat as many carbs as needed till you feel satisfied. Carbs should only come from fruits, vegetables and rice, roots (like yams, potatoes, beets),  lentils, beans, buckwheat and Quinoa. You should want to avoid gluten because wheat has been hybridized too much that its now inflammatory within the human body.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">2.

Sometimes that change will be all that you need to do to get past a plateau. <br>I might add, don't diet. Eat right. Big difference. Basically, I eat what I want as long as my abs are still ok and I feel good. For this reason I seldom eat fried chicken. The results aren't pretty. Nuff said. <br>If you can, take supplements.

You would not realize it the first couple of days but it really will start making a difference. So tell yourself you're not going to quit, no matter what.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">2. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Expectations:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Don't think that your muscles are going to rip out and you'll suddenly transform yourself to somebody else. That can happen, but it usually happens to 10% of gym goers - some people are genetically disposed to get bigger or better toned muscles, some people are able to push the intensity up much better than others, etc. But ultimately, you have to be in it for the long haul, and to stay fit. So keep your expectations realistic - that doesn't mean you should stop dreaming big.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">3. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Body parts:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Identify the different exercises that you can do for each muscle: chest, shoulders, back, biceps, triceps, abs, legs, forearms. Identify the correct technique for each exercise. Identify the highest weight you can do them without discomfort. For the first two weeks, use these weights and get your form right. After that switch to higher weights so that you can push yourself.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">4. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Routine:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Go to the gym at least 5 days a week. Identify two body parts you will work out each day. I used to work out each part twice a week - one big and one small muscle. My combinations would typically be: (1) chest + shoulder, (2) back + biceps + abs, (3) legs + triceps + forearms - twice a week each for 6 gym visits.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">5. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Cardio + lifting?</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Separate cardio and weights as far as possible. Light warm-up exercises before lifting, stretching during lifting, and some very light stretching / relaxing exercises post lifting - which could even be simply lying down eyes closed and breathing deep - that's all you need. If you want to do intense cardio, do it on different days. In any case, don't exhaust yourself with intense cardio before you start lifting.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">6. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Diet:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Eat right - going to the gym does not give you a license to eat junk just because you're burning more calories. A diet has a much, much bigger role to play in how you look than exercise (people may or may not agree, but this is my observation).</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Go to the gym well hydrated, without caffeine in your blood preferably, and with just a little bit of food in your stomach - don't exercise while you're starving, don't go on a full-stomach. Post work-out, eat something light - preferrably pulses / lean meat / eggs.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Eat everything in moderation - don't try any fad diets. Make sure you're taking enough protein in the form of fish / eggs / pulses and legumes, some meat, yogurt. Make sure you're taking the right amount of fats - flax seeds / nuts, etc. Eat five meals daily.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">7. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Quantum:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Do not over do it. Working out 45 - 50 minutes is more than adequate. Overtraining can result in bad injuries and long term effects.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">8. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Breathing:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Make absolutely sure that you're breathing well. Working out at a steady pace with a good breathing is more important than working out really fast and then passing out.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">9. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Commitment / discipline:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> You should never be done with working out - it should be a regular habit. It should cause the same amount of agony to go without working out as it should to go without food / sleep. Buy dumb-bells / bar-bells for home or set up a home gym if you have the space. It doesn't cost a bomb. There will be times when you would not be able to visit the gym everyday - work out at home - even if it be for 20 - 30 minutes.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">All the best.</span></p> ",

I can add that getting good sleep and rest between workouts is essential for muscle growth, and good nutrition is very important. I suggest taking creatine and d-ribose before your workouts, and whey protein afterward. You'll get faster results.</span></p> ",

Don’t give lame excuses to yourself for skipping workouts. Have full faith in yourself that you will succeed in achieving your goal.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(2) Goal</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: The second most important point is to set a specific and clear goal. Ask yourself a question, what do you want to achieve with bodybuilding?</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(3) Good instructor</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Look out for an instructor with proven record of training people.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(4) Plan</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Once you have set out a goal, next step is to plan the steps to achieve that result. Obviously, there may be some changes in the plan at later stages but you should have a plan from the very start. Planning will have two important parts:</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">a) Plan your workout</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: You can ask your trainer in the Gym to guide you to the best workouts for beginners. However when I started, I did complete body exercises every two days (As per the instructions of my coach). This continued for 14 days and then changed to Push- Pull- Leg and then One body part each day. My favourite is Push-Pull-Leg.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">b) Plan your diet</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Every bodybuilder will tell you that a proper diet is the core of bodybuilding and this is true. You should drink plenty of water throughout the day and focus on adequate intake of Fibre, Carbohydrate, Healthy fats and Protein. The amount of protein should be 1.2 to 2 grams per Kg of your body weight per day.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(5) Avoid injuries</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Do not try to become a hero on the very first day of your workout by lifting heavy weights. Remember, you cannot build muscles in one day, but by working out consistently over a period of time. Increase the weights gradually as per your body capacity.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(6) Motivation and consistency</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Once the motivation is gone, people start skipping the workouts. Write down a note and paste it on a wall where you can see it daily (note should mention whatever motivated you for bodybuilding in the first place).</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(7) Ask for feedback from coach</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Normally if you don’t have a personal instructor, you will have to go and ask for his feedback and improvements. Ask him if you need any improvements, he will probably highlight them in case of incorrect exercise form and other mistakes. (Mostly applicable in India)</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(8) Correct form of exercise</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Focus on the correct form of exercise and get feedback from your coach/instructor.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(9) Rest and recover</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Rest is very crucial for bodybuilding, Take sufficient rest and let your body recover.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">(10) No steroids</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">: Do not take steroids for bodybuilding. Instead, you can add good quality protein supplements in your diet which can help you to gradually gain muscle mass.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Hope this helps.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Please upvote if found helpful :)</span></p> ",

Bodybuilding tips recommend you get at most 6 hours of sleep without any disturbance to ensure that your body is well revitalized for your next workout session.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">3.\tEat and eat right</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">With a bodybuilding workout, you are forcing your body to build mass. However, at the same time you need to eat a lot to provide your body with fuel for this growth. As a part of the bodybuilding tips, you need to aim for a minimum of 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight. Ensure that you have copious amount of fruit and vegetable serving at every sitting. The best way, to consume food, is to follow a strict diet suited to a bodybuilding regime. At the same time, ensure that you sufficiently hydrate yourself before or after your workouts.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">4.\tTraining</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">This is the crucial step to bodybuilding. For beginners who want to go about on their own training, look for an authentic source that will provide you with a workout regime that will suit your requirements. Aim for a regime that will provide you long term success, while providing you solid information on each form and technique. You do not want to be ‘THAT’ individual who builds larger muscles without power, only to end up looking like a fool when push comes to a shove. Focus your training on building a strong foundation with the basic movements, before moving to isolation exercises when you’ve built some solid, basic mass and strength.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">5.\tPersonal trainer versus self-training</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Here is the thing, you can find plenty of sources online and through books that will help you in strength training. But bodybuilding tips recommend opting for a decent strength coach, as he or she can observe your body and help you follow a strict regime in terms of your diet and workout. A good coach assesses your basic movement patterns, flexibility, and strength levels before designing a program for you.</span></p> ",

You will have to experiment a bit to figure out what your body responds best to, in terms of macros, meal timing (do you prefer a few big meals or many small meals? Do you like doing your cardio fasted? how much food do you need/when do you need it to feel your best when you lfit? etc) and, of course, cutting and bulking cycles often take a few tries to really get comfortable with.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">As far as programs go, the main thing to keep in mind is that if you are physically capable, your program should predominately focus on squatting, bench pressing, overhead pressing, deadlifting, and rowing/chins. Doing other accessories to address weak points is fine, but don't get so stuck on accessories that it hinders your performance on big lifts. I would recommend checking out programs such as SS, SL, ICF 5x5, Reg Park's novice 5x5, ALL PRO or a couple others. Pick one, and stick to it until it has run it's course and you can't make gains on it anymore. After that, look into a more advanced routine and read up on periodization/programming theories. You should know enough about your body by then to get a little more creative.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Start basic with a solid foundation and build from there. I would be a lot bigger and stronger than I am now had I started out simple years ago. A complicated routine doesn't always make a better routine.</span></p> ",

As far as starting out is concerned just try one one of the beginner programs you can find there and stick to it for the duration of that program.
