You would not realize it the first couple of days but it really will start making a difference. So tell yourself you're not going to quit, no matter what.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">2. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Expectations:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Don't think that your muscles are going to rip out and you'll suddenly transform yourself to somebody else. That can happen, but it usually happens to 10% of gym goers - some people are genetically disposed to get bigger or better toned muscles, some people are able to push the intensity up much better than others, etc. But ultimately, you have to be in it for the long haul, and to stay fit. So keep your expectations realistic - that doesn't mean you should stop dreaming big.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">3. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Body parts:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Identify the different exercises that you can do for each muscle: chest, shoulders, back, biceps, triceps, abs, legs, forearms. Identify the correct technique for each exercise. Identify the highest weight you can do them without discomfort. For the first two weeks, use these weights and get your form right. After that switch to higher weights so that you can push yourself.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">4. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Routine:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Go to the gym at least 5 days a week. Identify two body parts you will work out each day. I used to work out each part twice a week - one big and one small muscle. My combinations would typically be: (1) chest + shoulder, (2) back + biceps + abs, (3) legs + triceps + forearms - twice a week each for 6 gym visits.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">5. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Cardio + lifting?</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Separate cardio and weights as far as possible. Light warm-up exercises before lifting, stretching during lifting, and some very light stretching / relaxing exercises post lifting - which could even be simply lying down eyes closed and breathing deep - that's all you need. If you want to do intense cardio, do it on different days. In any case, don't exhaust yourself with intense cardio before you start lifting.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">6. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Diet:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Eat right - going to the gym does not give you a license to eat junk just because you're burning more calories. A diet has a much, much bigger role to play in how you look than exercise (people may or may not agree, but this is my observation).</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Go to the gym well hydrated, without caffeine in your blood preferably, and with just a little bit of food in your stomach - don't exercise while you're starving, don't go on a full-stomach. Post work-out, eat something light - preferrably pulses / lean meat / eggs.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Eat everything in moderation - don't try any fad diets. Make sure you're taking enough protein in the form of fish / eggs / pulses and legumes, some meat, yogurt. Make sure you're taking the right amount of fats - flax seeds / nuts, etc. Eat five meals daily.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">7. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Quantum:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Do not over do it. Working out 45 - 50 minutes is more than adequate. Overtraining can result in bad injuries and long term effects.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">8. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Breathing:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> Make absolutely sure that you're breathing well. Working out at a steady pace with a good breathing is more important than working out really fast and then passing out.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">9. </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Commitment / discipline:</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> You should never be done with working out - it should be a regular habit. It should cause the same amount of agony to go without working out as it should to go without food / sleep. Buy dumb-bells / bar-bells for home or set up a home gym if you have the space. It doesn't cost a bomb. There will be times when you would not be able to visit the gym everyday - work out at home - even if it be for 20 - 30 minutes.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">All the best.</span></p> ",

It grows when you are resting.

The mistakes you make are your lessons. I would like to share some of the mistakes I made during my intial days/years. I started going to the gym during my first year in college. It was a crappy gym with very few equipment. They had a few dumbbells and and a couple of barbells. The worst part was</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">there was no trainer</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">. Yes, you heard it right. A gym filled with many first timers and beginners like myself and no trainer. This was enough to give you a list of mistakes I made as a beginner. Let me try to recollect and list down a few:</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Not doing sufficient warm up.</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"><br>* Doing </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">bicep curls on my first day</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> and regretting it for the rest of the week.<br>* Thinking </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">isolation movements</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> are better than compounded movements.<br>* Trying to curl 20kg before I could properly bench press the same weight.<br>* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Never training my legs</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> in those days.<br>* </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">No cardio</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> ever.<br>* No clue about the significance of protein in my diet and eating all the rice and everything I could eat in the hostel mess, thinking it is good for me as am working out now.<br>* The worst mistake I ever made though was </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">improper form</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">, resulting from doing certain workouts without any guidance or supervision. I just see someone do something and then try to imitate it. Within a year I managed to injure my wrists, shoulders and knees.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">It has been </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;\">7 years since my first day at the gym</span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\"> and now when I look back, everyone of those mistakes and injuries have taught me important lessons. Be smart. It is okay to make mistakes. But it is never okay to be stubborn and to not adapt or to not learn from your mistakes.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Last, but definitely not the least, your nutrition. You are what you eat! Get enough protein. Get enough carbs, fats and other nutrients to support your body. The question is what is enough. If you are really serious about working out and is training hard then you need to consume about 1-2 gms of protein per pound of your body weight. Again, this is applicable only if you are training hard and lifting heavy. If you are looking to bulk up, then you need to eat a calorie surplus; meaning more carbs and fats. If you are trying to cut down, then eat at a calorie deficit. Try to make sure that your diet contains as much raw food as you can think of. Besides that, cook as much as you can and avoid processed/canned foods as much as possible. Have a cheat meal every week to keep yourself in the game and to not feel like you are punishing yourself.</span></p> <p class=\"q-text qu-display--block\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; word-break: break-word; direction: ltr; text-align: start;\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;\">Also, make sure to bring about sufficient variety in your routine once every 2 months or so. These are some generic rules for starters. If you can follow them you should be on the right track. By that time you would have had enough experience or made enough friends in body building who knows the craft better than someone who is not into it but has only a general idea of the proceedings.</span></p> ",

I can add that getting good sleep and rest between workouts is essential for muscle growth, and good nutrition is very important. I suggest taking creatine and d-ribose before your workouts, and whey protein afterward. You'll get faster results.</span></p> ",
